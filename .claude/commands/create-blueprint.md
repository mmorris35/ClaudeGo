# Create System Blueprint

Let's create a comprehensive System Blueprint for your project idea! This process transforms rough ideas into detailed technical plans.

## What This Does

I'll guide you through 6 phases to develop a complete blueprint:

**Phase 1: Vision & Strategy** (30-45 min)
- Core vision and problem statement
- Strategic goals and success metrics
- Market positioning
- Team constraints and context

**Phase 2: Product Definition** (45-60 min)
- User personas
- Core features (5-7 for MVP)
- User flows
- **Extensibility vision** (critical for architecture decisions)
- Non-functional requirements

**Phase 3: Technical Architecture** (60-90 min)
- I'll recommend architecture pattern based on your needs
- Complete tech stack with reasoning
- Data architecture strategy
- API design philosophy
- Security architecture
- Plugin system design (if extensibility needed)

**Phase 4: Data & API Design** (45-60 min)
- I'll design complete database schema
- Entity relationships
- API endpoint specifications
- Integration points

**Phase 5: Operations & Quality** (30-45 min)
- I'll recommend testing strategy
- CI/CD pipeline design
- Monitoring and observability
- Documentation plan

**Phase 6: Growth Planning** (30 min)
- Scalability roadmap with triggers
- Feature roadmap
- Team scaling plan
- Business model evolution

**Total Time**: 3-4 hours for a comprehensive blueprint

## What You'll Get

A complete `SYSTEM_BLUEPRINT.md` file containing:

âœ… **Your Vision** - Problem, goals, and strategy (from our conversation)
ðŸ¤– **My Recommendations** - Architecture, tech stack, and patterns (I analyze and propose)
ðŸ“‹ **Ready-to-Build Specs** - Data models, APIs, deployment strategy (I design)
ðŸš€ **Growth Plan** - Scaling strategy and roadmap (we plan together)

## Important Notes

1. **I'll Make Technical Decisions**: Based on your requirements, constraints, and extensibility needs, I'll recommend specific technologies and patterns. You can approve, adjust, or reject my proposals.

2. **Extensibility Matters**: In Phase 2, we'll discuss who should be able to extend your system (nobody, internal devs, or third-party developers). This significantly influences architecture decisions.

3. **Honest Constraints**: Be realistic about team size, timeline, and budget. I'll use this to make pragmatic recommendations (not over-engineered, not under-planned).

4. **Living Document**: The blueprint evolves. We start with MVP, plan for growth, and identify when to revisit decisions.

5. **You Can Jump Sections**: While sequential is recommended for first-timers, you can say "Let's work on section 3.2" to jump ahead.

## Let's Begin!

I'm ready to start Phase 1: Vision & Strategy.

**First question:** Tell me about your project idea in 2-3 sentences. What problem does it solve, and who is it for?

## Quick Reference

**To jump to a specific section:**
- "Let's work on section 2.4" (Extensibility Vision)
- "Let's work on Phase 3" (Technical Architecture)

**To review progress:**
- "Show me what we've covered so far"
- "Summarize our decisions"

**To save progress:**
- I'll automatically save completed phases to `SYSTEM_BLUEPRINT.md`
- You can continue anytime

**For help:**
- "What's section 3.2 about?"
- "Show me an example for Phase 2"
- Refer to `/docs/BLUEPRINT_GUIDE.md` for detailed documentation

Ready? Let's create something amazing!
