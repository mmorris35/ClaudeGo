# ClaudeGo - Easy Claude Code Setup for Mac

Get Claude Code running in VSCode on your Mac in just a few minutes. Download one script, run it, and you're ready to go.

## üí∞ Cost Transparency

**Claude Code requires a Claude Pro subscription at $20/month** (or $17/month with annual billing).

There is a free tier for Claude.ai, but it does not include Claude Code access. You must upgrade to Pro or higher to use Claude Code in VSCode.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need:

1. **A Mac** running macOS (these scripts are Mac-only)
2. **GitHub Account**
   - Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and create an account if you don't have one
3. **Claude Account with Pro Subscription**
   - Go to [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) and create an account
   - Upgrade to Pro plan ($20/month) at [claude.ai/settings/billing](https://claude.ai/settings/billing)

   cd ~/Downloads
   ```
4. Run the installation script:
   ```bash
   chmod +x install.sh
   ./install.sh
   ```

The script will:
- ‚úÖ Verify you have Claude Pro subscription
- ‚úÖ Install Homebrew (if needed)
- ‚úÖ Install VSCode (if not already installed)
- ‚úÖ Install the Claude Code extension

### Step 2: Fork This Repository

1. Go to [github.com/mmorris35/ClaudeGo](https://github.com/mmorris35/ClaudeGo)
2. Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner
3. This creates your own copy of the repository on your GitHub account

### Step 3: Clone Your Forked Repository in VSCode

Once installation completes:

1. Open VSCode (it's now installed)
2. Press `Cmd+Shift+P` to open the Command Palette
3. Type "Git: Clone" and select it
4. Paste this URL: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ClaudeGo.git` (use your own GitHub username)
5. Choose a folder location and click "Open"

### Step 4: Authenticate with Claude

In VSCode Terminal (`Terminal > New Terminal` or `Ctrl+~`), run:

```bash
claude auth login
```

**IMPORTANT:** When prompted, select the authentication method:
- ‚úÖ **Choose "Login with Claude.ai account"** (this uses your Pro/Max subscription)
- ‚ùå **DO NOT choose "API Key"** (this is for API usage, not Claude Code)

Follow the prompts to:
1. Your browser will open to authenticate
2. Log in with your Claude account (the one with Pro subscription)
3. Authorize the connection
4. Return to VSCode - you're authenticated!

To verify authentication worked, run:
```bash
claude status
```

You should see your account information and subscription status.

## Verification

Want to check if everything is set up correctly? In VSCode Terminal, run:

```bash
claude status
```

This will show you your Claude authentication status. You can also verify the installation by:

1. Press `Cmd+Shift+P` in VSCode
2. Type "Claude" to see available commands
3. If you see Claude commands, you're all set!

## Troubleshooting

### "Authentication failed"

1. Make sure you have an active Claude Pro subscription at [claude.ai/settings/billing](https://claude.ai/settings/billing)
2. In VSCode Terminal, run:
   ```bash
   claude auth login
   ```
3. Follow the authentication prompts

### "Homebrew installation failed"

The `install.sh` script will attempt to install Homebrew. If it fails:

1. Visit [brew.sh](https://brew.sh) for manual installation instructions
2. Once Homebrew is installed, run `install.sh` again

### "VSCode won't open or command not found"

After running `install.sh`:
1. Restart your Terminal
2. Try opening VSCode again with `code`
3. If that doesn't work, open VSCode from Applications

## Creating a System Blueprint for Your Project

Once you have Claude Code set up, use it to create comprehensive technical plans for your projects!

### What is a System Blueprint?

A System Blueprint is a complete technical and product specification document that covers:
- üìã Vision and strategy
- üë• User personas and features
- üèóÔ∏è Technical architecture (Claude recommends based on your needs)
- üíæ Database schema and API design
- üß™ Testing and deployment strategies
- üöÄ Growth and scaling plans

### Why Create a Blueprint?

- **Reduce project risk** - Think through problems before coding
- **Speed up development** - Clear specs = faster implementation
- **Make better decisions** - Claude analyzes your constraints and recommends optimal architecture
- **Onboard team members** - Complete documentation in one place
- **Plan for scale** - Know when and how to evolve your architecture

### How It Works

1. **You provide context** (30-45 min per phase):
   - Your project idea, goals, and constraints
   - Target users and features
   - Team size, timeline, and budget

2. **Claude analyzes and recommends** (I do the heavy lifting):
   - Architecture pattern (monolith vs microservices)
   - Complete tech stack with reasoning
   - Database schema design
   - API specifications
   - Security strategy
   - Scaling plan

3. **You get a complete blueprint** (3-4 hours total):
   - Professional `SYSTEM_BLUEPRINT.md` file
   - Ready to use as foundation for your new project repo
   - Living document that evolves with your project

### Quick Start with Blueprint Creation

In VSCode with Claude Code installed, use the slash command:

```
/create-blueprint
```

Or start manually:
```
"Let's create a system blueprint for my project. I'm ready for Phase 1."
```

### Documentation

- üìñ **[Complete Guide](docs/BLUEPRINT_GUIDE.md)** - Detailed walkthrough of all 6 phases
- üìù **[Template](docs/BLUEPRINT_TEMPLATE.md)** - See what the final blueprint looks like
- üéØ **[Specification](BLUEPRINT_SYSTEM_SPEC.md)** - How the system works

### Example Flow

```
You: "/create-blueprint"

Claude: "Let's create a comprehensive System Blueprint! This takes 3-4 hours
but results in a complete technical plan.

Phase 1: Tell me about your project idea in 2-3 sentences. What problem
does it solve?"

You: "A collaborative task management tool for remote teams across time zones..."

Claude: "Great! Let me ask some clarifying questions about your vision..."

[After Phase 1-2, Claude analyzes your requirements]

Claude: "Based on your requirements:
- 2 developers, 3-month timeline
- Real-time features needed
- 5K users expected in year 1
- Medium extensibility (API + webhooks in v2)

I recommend:
- Architecture: Modular Monolith
- Backend: FastAPI (Python)
- Frontend: React + TypeScript
- Database: PostgreSQL + Redis
- Hosting: Railway

Here's my reasoning..."
```

### Key Features

‚úÖ **Extensibility-Aware**: Claude asks about your extensibility needs early, then designs architecture accordingly

‚úÖ **Intelligent Recommendations**: Not just documenting‚ÄîClaude makes smart tech stack decisions based on your constraints

‚úÖ **Pragmatic**: Recommendations match your team size, timeline, and budget (no over-engineering)

‚úÖ **Complete**: Covers everything from vision to deployment strategy

‚úÖ **Production-Ready**: Specifications are detailed enough to start building immediately

### What You'll Learn

Even if you don't use the final blueprint, the process helps you:
- Think through architecture decisions systematically
- Understand trade-offs between different approaches
- Plan for scale from day one
- Identify risks and dependencies early
- Budget time and resources accurately
