- Map flows to features

#### 2.4 Extensibility Vision
**Prompts** (NEW - critical for architecture):
- "Who should be able to extend this system?"
  - [ ] Internal developers only
  - [ ] Power users (via UI customization)
  - [ ] Third-party developers (via API/plugins)
  - [ ] No extensibility needed

- "What should be extensible?"
  - [ ] UI/themes
  - [ ] Business logic/workflows
  - [ ] Integrations with other services
  - [ ] Data models
  - [ ] Complete custom features (plugin system)

- "Timeline for extensibility?"
  - [ ] MVP (v1.0)
  - [ ] Post-launch (v2.0)
  - [ ] Future consideration

- "Extensibility examples you admire?"
  - (e.g., "Like Shopify apps" or "Like VSCode extensions")

**Claude's role**:
- Explain implications of each choice
- Suggest extensibility models based on similar products
- **Use this to drive architecture decisions in Phase 3**

**Claude's analysis**:
```
Extensibility Level: [None / Low / Medium / High]

Implications:
- Architecture: [How this affects design]

- Timeline: [Impact on MVP]
- Ecosystem: [Potential for marketplace/community]

Recommendation: [Claude's suggestion based on constraints]
```

#### 2.5 Out of Scope
**Prompts**:
- "What are you explicitly NOT building?"
- "What features have you considered and rejected?"

**Claude's role**:
- Document scope boundaries
- Prevent scope creep later

---

### Phase 3: Technical Architecture
**Nature**: Claude proposes, user reviews/adjusts
**Duration**: ~60-90 minutes

**CRITICAL**: Claude uses all previous inputs to make intelligent recommendations

#### 3.1 Architecture Philosophy
**Claude analyzes**:
- Team size → complexity tolerance
- Timeline → pragmatic vs ideal choices
- Extensibility needs → architecture pattern
- Scale expectations → initial vs future architecture
- Budget → hosting/infrastructure choices

**Claude proposes**:
```
Recommended Approach: [Monolith / Modular Monolith / Microservices]

Reasoning:
- Team size ([X] developers) suggests [choice]
- Timeline ([Y] months) favors [choice]
- Extensibility needs ([level]) require [choice]
- Expected scale ([users]) can start with [choice]

Trade-offs:
- Pros: [List]
- Cons: [List]
- When to revisit: [Trigger point for re-architecture]
```

#### 3.2 Technology Stack Recommendation

**Claude's decision process**:

1. **Analyze requirements**:
   - Real-time needs? → WebSockets, Server-Sent Events
   - Data complexity? → SQL vs NoSQL
   - Team skills? → Leverage existing knowledge
   - Deployment complexity? → Simpler stack for smaller teams
   - Extensibility? → Plugin-friendly frameworks

2. **Consider constraints**:
   - Budget → Open source, affordable hosting
   - Timeline → Mature ecosystems, fewer unknowns
   - Scale → Start simple, ensure migration path

3. **Propose stack with reasoning**:

```
Frontend:
- Framework: React
  Why: Large ecosystem, good for [feature X], team has experience
  Alternatives considered: Vue (simpler), Svelte (performance)

- State Management: Redux Toolkit
  Why: [Reasoning based on app complexity]

- UI Library: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
  Why: Fast development, professional look, extensible

Backend:
- Language/Framework: Node.js + Express
  Why: JavaScript across stack, great for [feature Y], plugin ecosystem
  Alternatives: Python/FastAPI (if team knows Python), Go (for performance)

- API Style: REST
  Why: Simpler for MVP, good client support
  Future: GraphQL when extensibility requirements grow

Database:
- Primary: PostgreSQL
  Why: JSONB for flexibility, reliable, good with [data pattern]

- Cache: Redis
  Why: [Real-time features need X]

Infrastructure:
- Hosting: Railway / Render
  Why: Quick deployment, affordable, good DX
  Future: Consider AWS/GCP at [scale point]

- CI/CD: GitHub Actions
  Why: Free, integrated, sufficient for needs
```

**User prompt**: "Does this stack align with your constraints? Any preferences or concerns?"

#### 3.3 Data Architecture

**Claude analyzes features and proposes**:
- Data relationships
- Storage strategies
- Caching needs
- Search requirements

```
Data Strategy:
- Primary Storage: PostgreSQL (relational data)
- File Storage: S3-compatible (user uploads)
- Cache Layer: Redis (session, frequently accessed data)
- Search: PostgreSQL full-text (MVP), ElasticSearch (if complex search needed)

Reasoning: [Based on features requiring each]
```

#### 3.4 API Design Philosophy

**Claude proposes based on extensibility needs**:

**Low extensibility**:
```
API Approach: Internal REST API
- Purpose: Frontend communication only
- Documentation: OpenAPI spec for internal team
- Versioning: Not critical initially
```

**Medium extensibility**:
```
API Approach: Public REST API
- Purpose: Third-party integrations
- Documentation: Public OpenAPI spec, interactive docs
- Versioning: /v1/ prefix, 12-month deprecation policy
- Rate limiting: Required
- Authentication: API keys + OAuth2
```

**High extensibility (Plugin system)**:
```
API Approach: Multi-layer API
1. Public REST API (external integrations)
2. Plugin SDK (JavaScript/Python library)
3. Webhook system (event notifications)
4. GraphQL (flexible data queries for power users)

Extension Points:
- UI Components: React components in plugin bundle
- Backend Hooks: Events system (pre/post actions)
- Data Access: Controlled via SDK, scoped permissions
- Configuration: UI for plugin settings

Plugin Architecture:
- Sandboxing: Isolated execution context
- Permissions: Granular access control
- Versioning: Semantic versioning, compatibility checks
- Distribution: Plugin registry/marketplace
```

#### 3.5 Security Architecture

**Claude proposes based on**:
- User types (public / private / enterprise)
- Data sensitivity
- Compliance requirements

```
Security Strategy:
- Authentication: [JWT / Session / OAuth - with reasoning]
- Authorization: [RBAC / ABAC - based on complexity]
- Data Protection: [Encryption at rest/transit]
- API Security: [Rate limiting, API keys]
- Compliance: [GDPR, SOC2 considerations if relevant]
```

#### 3.6 Extension Architecture (if applicable)

**Only included if user wants extensibility**

**Claude designs**:
```
Plugin System Design:
- Load Mechanism: [Dynamic imports / Registry pattern]
- API Surface: [What plugins can access]
- Lifecycle Hooks: [When plugins can execute]
  - onInstall, onEnable, onDisable, onUninstall
  - beforeRequest, afterRequest
  - onDataCreate, onDataUpdate, onDataDelete

- Sandboxing Strategy: [How to isolate plugin code]
- Permission Model: [What plugins must request]
- Development Experience:
  - SDK/CLI for plugin development
  - Local development server
  - Testing framework
  - Documentation generator
```

**Example hook system**:
```javascript
// Core system provides hooks
hooks.register('task.created', async (task) => {
  // Plugins can subscribe
  await notificationPlugin.send(task);
  await analyticsPlugin.track('task_created', task);
});
```

---

### Phase 4: Data & API Design
**Nature**: Claude designs, user validates
**Duration**: ~45-60 minutes

#### 4.1 Data Models

**Claude analyzes features and creates entity models**:

For each entity:
```
Entity: Task
Purpose: Represents a work item in the system

Fields:
- id: UUID (primary key)
- title: string (required, max 200)
- description: text (optional)
- status: enum ['todo', 'in_progress', 'done']
- assignee_id: UUID (foreign key → User)
- created_at: timestamp
- updated_at: timestamp

Relationships:
- belongs_to: User (assignee)
- has_many: Comments
- has_many: Attachments

Indexes:
- assignee_id (frequent queries by user)
- status (filtering)
- created_at (sorting)

Validation:
- title presence and length
- status must be valid enum

Extensibility:
- custom_fields: JSONB (for plugin-added fields)
- metadata: JSONB (plugin-specific data)
```

**Claude's reasoning**: "Based on your task management features, these are the core entities needed..."

#### 4.2 Database Schema

**Claude generates**:
```sql
-- Core tables
CREATE TABLE users (...);
CREATE TABLE tasks (...);
CREATE TABLE comments (...);

-- Extension tables (if plugin system)
CREATE TABLE plugins (...);
CREATE TABLE plugin_settings (...);
CREATE TABLE custom_field_definitions (...);
```

#### 4.3 API Endpoints

**Claude designs endpoints for each feature**:

```
Endpoint: POST /api/v1/tasks
Purpose: Create a new task

Authentication: Required (JWT)
Authorization: User must have 'create_task' permission

Request:
{
  "title": "string (required, max 200)",
  "description": "string (optional)",
  "assignee_id": "uuid (optional)",
  "due_date": "ISO 8601 date (optional)"
}

Response (201 Created):
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "title": "string",
  "status": "todo",
  "created_at": "ISO 8601",
  ...
}

Errors:
- 400: Validation error
- 401: Not authenticated
- 403: No permission
- 429: Rate limit exceeded

Extensibility Hooks (if plugin system):
- before_create: Plugins can validate/modify data
- after_create: Plugins notified of new task
```

**Complete API for MVP**: Claude lists all endpoints needed

#### 4.4 Integration Points

**Claude identifies based on features**:
- Email service (transactional emails)
- Payment processor (if monetization)
- Storage service (file uploads)
- Authentication provider (social login)
- Analytics service

**For each integration**:
```
Integration: SendGrid (Email)
Purpose: Transactional emails (welcome, notifications, password reset)
Cost: Free tier → 100 emails/day
Environment Variables: SENDGRID_API_KEY
Error Handling: Retry with exponential backoff, dead letter queue
```

---

### Phase 5: Operations & Quality
**Nature**: Claude recommends, user adjusts
**Duration**: ~30-45 minutes

#### 5.1 Testing Strategy

**Claude proposes based on**:
- Project criticality
- Team size
- Timeline pressure

```
Testing Approach: Pragmatic for MVP

Unit Tests:
- Coverage target: 60% (focus on business logic)
- Framework: Jest (frontend), Vitest (backend)
- What to test: Core features, data models, utilities
- What to skip initially: UI snapshots, edge cases

Integration Tests:
- API endpoint tests
- Database integration tests
- External service mocks

E2E Tests:
- Critical user flows only (login, core action)
- Tool: Playwright
- Run: Pre-deployment

Testing Phases:
- MVP: Unit + basic integration
- Post-launch: Add E2E for critical paths
- Scaling phase: Increase coverage, add performance tests
```

#### 5.2 Development Workflow

**Claude proposes**:
```
Git Strategy: GitHub Flow (simple, single main branch)
- Feature branches → PR → main
- Deploy from main

Branch Protection:
- Require PR reviews (if team > 1)
- Require tests to pass
- No force push to main

Code Review:
- [Based on team size]
- PR template with checklist

Environments:
- Local development
- Staging (preview deployments)
- Production
```

#### 5.3 CI/CD Pipeline

**Claude designs**:
```
Pipeline: GitHub Actions

On Pull Request:
1. Lint code
2. Run unit tests
3. Run integration tests
4. Build preview deployment

On Merge to Main:
1. Run full test suite
2. Build production bundle
3. Deploy to staging
4. Run smoke tests
5. Deploy to production (auto or manual approval)

Rollback Plan:
- Keep last 3 deployments
- One-click rollback via hosting platform
```

#### 5.4 Monitoring & Observability

**Claude recommends based on complexity**:

```
Logging:
- Framework: Winston / Pino
- Levels: error, warn, info, debug
- Structure: JSON for parsing
- Storage: CloudWatch / Papertrail (free tier initially)

Error Tracking:
- Service: Sentry (free tier: 5K events/month)
- Capture: Unhandled exceptions, API errors
- Alerts: Slack/email for critical errors

Metrics:
- Basic: Server metrics (CPU, memory, response time)
- Tool: Hosting platform built-in (Railway, Render)
- Future: Prometheus + Grafana at scale

Health Checks:
- Endpoint: GET /health
- Checks: Database connection, external services
- Used by: Load balancer, uptime monitors

Uptime Monitoring:
- Service: UptimeRobot (free tier: 50 monitors)
- Check: Every 5 minutes
- Alert: Email/SMS on downtime
```

#### 5.5 Security Implementation

**Claude specifies**:
```
Security Measures:

Authentication:
- Password: bcrypt hashing (cost factor 12)
- Session: JWT with httpOnly cookies
- 2FA: Optional (TOTP via authenticator app)

Authorization:
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Middleware checks on all protected routes
- Principle of least privilege

Input Validation:
- Library: Zod / Joi
- Validate all API inputs
- Sanitize user-generated content

Protection:
- SQL Injection: Parameterized queries (ORM)
- XSS: Content Security Policy headers, sanitization
- CSRF: CSRF tokens for state-changing operations
- Rate Limiting: Express-rate-limit (100 req/15min per IP)

Data Protection:
- Encryption in transit: TLS/SSL (force HTTPS)
- Encryption at rest: Database encryption
- Secrets: Environment variables, never in code
- PII handling: [Based on compliance needs]

Dependency Security:
- Automated: Dependabot / Snyk
- Monthly: Manual audit of critical dependencies
```

### Phase 6: Growth & Extensibility Planning
**Nature**: Claude projects future needs
**Duration**: ~30 minutes

#### 6.1 Scalability Roadmap

**Claude analyzes and plans**:

```
Current Architecture Limits:
- Single server: ~1K concurrent users
- PostgreSQL: ~10K active users
- Current stack good until: ~50K users

Scaling Triggers:
- At 5K users: Add caching layer (Redis)
- At 10K users: Database read replicas
- At 50K users: Consider microservices for [heavy features]
- At 100K users: CDN for static assets, separate job queue

Bottleneck Analysis:
[Based on features, Claude identifies likely bottlenecks]
- Feature: Real-time notifications
  - Bottleneck: WebSocket connections per server
  - Solution: Redis pub/sub, multiple app servers

Cost Projection:
- 0-1K users: $50/month (single server)
- 1K-10K users: $200/month (caching, monitoring)
- 10K-50K users: $1K/month (replicas, CDN)
```

#### 6.2 Feature Roadmap

## Claude's Decision-Making Framework

### How Claude Uses Context

**From Phase 1 (Vision):**
- Project type → Suggests relevant architectures
- Success metrics → Influences monitoring needs
- Constraints → Limits stack choices

**From Phase 2 (Product):**
- Features → Determines technical requirements
- Extensibility needs → **Drives architecture pattern**
- User types → Security and UX considerations

**From Phase 2.4 (Extensibility) specifically:**
- None → Monolithic architecture, faster development
- Low → Modular architecture, clear boundaries
- Medium → API-first, webhooks, clear extension points
- High → Full plugin system, event-driven architecture

**Cross-phase Analysis:**
- Feature complexity + Team size → Technology choices
- Scale expectations + Timeline → Initial vs ideal architecture
- Extensibility + Budget → Infrastructure planning

### Example Decision Tree: Architecture Pattern

```
IF extensibility == "High (plugin system)" THEN
  → Event-driven architecture
  → Plugin SDK and marketplace
  → Strict API versioning
  → Sandbox execution

ELSE IF extensibility == "Medium (API/webhooks)" THEN
  → Modular monolith
  → Well-documented REST API
  → Webhook system
  → API versioning

ELSE IF team_size <= 2 AND timeline <= 3_months THEN
  → Monolithic architecture
  → Focus on core features
  → Refactor for extensibility in v2

ELSE IF expected_scale > 100K_users THEN
  → Modular monolith (prepare for microservices)
  → Clear service boundaries
  → Shared data models
```

### Example Decision Tree: Tech Stack

```
IF team_knows == "Python" AND real_time_needs == false THEN
  → Backend: FastAPI
  → Frontend: React (separate concerns)

ELSE IF team_knows == "JavaScript" AND real_time_needs == true THEN
  → Backend: Node.js + Socket.io
  → Frontend: React + WebSocket client

ELSE IF team_size == 1 AND timeline == "fast" THEN
  → Full-stack framework: Next.js / SvelteKit
  → Reduce API development overhead
```

---

## User Experience Flow

### Starting the Process

**Option 1: Guided (Recommended for first-time users)**
```
User: "I want to create a blueprint for my project"
Claude: "Great! Let's start with Phase 1: Vision & Strategy.
This will take about 30-45 minutes. We'll explore your core
idea, goals, and constraints. Ready to begin?"

User: "Yes"
Claude: [Starts Phase 1.1 prompts]
```

**Option 2: Direct Section**
```
User: "Let's work on section 3.2 - Technology Stack"
Claude: "I'll need context from earlier phases to make good
recommendations. Have you completed:
- Phase 1 (Vision & constraints)
- Phase 2.1-2.2 (Features)
- Phase 2.4 (Extensibility needs)?

If not, shall we do a quick overview of those first?"
```

**Option 3: Slash Command**
```
User: /create-blueprint
Claude: [Same as Option 1, interactive mode]

User: /create-blueprint 3.2
Claude: [Same as Option 2, check prerequisites]
```

### During a Phase

**Claude's approach:**
1. Introduce the phase and what we'll accomplish
2. Ask questions one at a time (or small groups)
3. Summarize user's inputs
4. Ask if anything is missing or needs clarification
5. Save progress to SYSTEM_BLUEPRINT.md
6. Preview next phase

**Example interaction:**
```
Claude: "Let's talk about your core features for MVP.
What are the 5-7 essential features users need?"

User: [Lists features]

Claude: "Got it. For each feature, I'll assess technical
complexity. Let's go deeper on the first one: [Feature X].

Walk me through how a user would use this feature."

User: [Describes flow]

Claude: "I see. This requires [technical needs].
I'm marking this as Medium complexity because [reasoning].

Ready for the next feature?"
```

### Between Phases

```
Claude: "Phase 2 complete! Here's what we've established:
- 3 user personas
- 6 core MVP features
- Medium extensibility (API + webhooks)
- 3-month timeline with 2 developers

I'm ready to propose a technical architecture in Phase 3.
This is where I'll recommend:
- Architecture pattern
- Technology stack
- Database design
- API approach

These recommendations will be based on everything we've
discussed. Shall we continue?"
```

### Claude's Proposal Format

```
Claude: "Based on your requirements, here's my recommendation:

**ARCHITECTURE PATTERN: Modular Monolith**

Reasoning:
✓ Team size (2 developers) - manageable complexity
✓ Timeline (3 months) - faster than microservices
✓ Extensibility (Medium) - can add webhooks/API
✓ Scale (5K users initially) - single deployment sufficient

Trade-offs:
+ Faster development
+ Simpler deployment
+ Easier debugging
- Harder to scale specific features independently
- Future migration to microservices may be needed

When to revisit:
- At 50K+ users
- When team grows to 5+ developers
- If one feature becomes a bottleneck

**Do you agree with this approach, or do you have concerns?**"
```

## Appendix C: Assumptions

Critical assumptions this blueprint relies on:

1. Team will remain at 2 developers for 6 months
2. Budget allows $200/month infrastructure by month 3
3. Users primarily on desktop (mobile secondary)
4. [etc.]

---

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve this blueprint
2. Set up development environment
3. Create repository structure
4. Begin Phase 1 implementation: [First sprint focus]
```

## File Structures

### .claude/commands/create-blueprint.md

```markdown
# Create System Blueprint

Interactive system to help you develop a comprehensive System Blueprint for your project idea.

## Usage

- `/create-blueprint` - Start the guided blueprint creation process
- `/create-blueprint [section]` - Jump to a specific section (e.g., `/create-blueprint 3.2`)
- `/create-blueprint review` - Review all captured inputs
- `/create-blueprint export` - Export the current blueprint

## How It Works

This command walks you through 6 phases:

1. **Vision & Strategy** - Define your project idea, goals, and constraints
2. **Product Definition** - Describe features, users, and extensibility needs
3. **Technical Architecture** - I'll recommend architecture and tech stack
4. **Data & API Design** - I'll design data models and API endpoints
5. **Operations & Quality** - I'll recommend testing, deployment, and monitoring
6. **Growth Planning** - We'll plan for scale and evolution

**Time Investment**: 3-4 hours for a complete blueprint

## What You'll Get

A comprehensive `SYSTEM_BLUEPRINT.md` file with:
- ✅ Your vision and requirements (from our conversation)
- 🤖 My technical recommendations (architecture, stack, patterns)
- 📋 Ready-to-develop specifications (data models, APIs, deployment)
- 🚀 Growth roadmap (scaling, features, team)

This blueprint becomes the foundation document for your new project repository.

Let's begin! I'll start with Phase 1: Vision & Strategy.

First, tell me about your project idea in 2-3 sentences. What problem does it solve?

## Questions for Review

Before building this system, please review and confirm:

1. **Phase structure** - Do the 6 phases cover everything you want?
2. **Extensibility emphasis** - Is the focus on extensibility decisions correct?
3. **Claude's role** - Happy with Claude proposing architecture vs just documenting?
4. **Output format** - Is SYSTEM_BLUEPRINT.md the right deliverable?
5. **User experience** - Does the interaction flow make sense?
6. **Missing pieces** - Anything else this should include?

---

## Success Criteria

This system succeeds when:
- ✅ User can transform vague idea → comprehensive blueprint in 3-4 hours
- ✅ Claude makes intelligent, context-aware recommendations
- ✅ Output is professional and ready for a project repository
- ✅ User understands trade-offs of all decisions
- ✅ Blueprint reduces project risk and speeds development
- ✅ System is reusable for any project type
