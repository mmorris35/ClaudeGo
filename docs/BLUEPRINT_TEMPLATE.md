# 1. Vision & Strategy üë§

**Status**: üìù Draft

## 1.1 Core Vision Statement ‚úÖ

**What is your project?**
```
[USER INPUT: 2-3 sentence description of your project]

Example:
A collaborative task management tool that helps remote teams coordinate work
across time zones with asynchronous communication and automatic scheduling.
```

**Problem it solves:**
```
[USER INPUT: What pain point are you addressing?]

Example:
Remote teams waste hours in synchronization meetings and lose context switching
between too many communication tools. Work gets blocked waiting for responses
across time zones.
```

**Target users:**
```
[USER INPUT: Who is this for?]

Example:
Remote-first teams of 5-50 people, especially those with significant time zone
spread (>4 hours difference).
```

## 1.2 Strategic Goals ‚úÖ

**6-month goal:**
```
[USER INPUT]

Example:
500 active users, validate product-market fit, achieve 20% weekly active user rate
```

**1-year goal:**
```
[USER INPUT]

Example:
5,000 users, $10K MRR, establish as go-to tool for async remote teams
```

**Top 3 Business Objectives:**
1. [USER INPUT]
2. [USER INPUT]
3. [USER INPUT]

**Primary Goal:**
- [ ] Generate revenue (SaaS, marketplace)
- [ ] Grow user base (network effects)
- [ ] Portfolio/learning project
- [ ] Internal tool (solve company problem)
- [ ] Open source community project

## 1.3 Success Metrics ‚úÖ

**Key Metrics to Track:**

| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| [USER INPUT] | [Target] | [Reason] |
| [USER INPUT] | [Target] | [Reason] |
| [USER INPUT] | [Target] | [Reason] |

Example:
| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Weekly Active Users | 20% | Indicates product stickiness |
| Time Saved Per User | 5+ hours/week | Core value proposition |
| MRR | $10K by month 12 | Sustainability |

## 1.4 Market Positioning ‚úÖ

**Competitors/Alternatives:**
```
[USER INPUT]

Example:
- Asana (general task management, not async-specific)
- Trello (simple, not built for remote teams)
- Monday.com (complex, expensive)
```

**Our Differentiation:**
```
[USER INPUT]

Example:
- Built specifically for async remote teams
- AI-powered scheduling across time zones
- Communication embedded in tasks (no context switching)
```

**Unfair Advantage:**
```
[USER INPUT]

Example:
- Founder has 10 years experience managing remote teams
- Access to 50-person remote company for beta testing
- Deep understanding of remote work pain points
```

## 1.5 Constraints & Context ‚úÖ

Infrastructure Budget: [USER INPUT - monthly spend tolerance]
Tool Budget: [USER INPUT - for development tools/services]
```

### Technical
```

Must-Use Technologies: [USER INPUT - required tech]
Must-Avoid Technologies: [USER INPUT - constraints]
```

### Regulatory/Compliance
```
Industry Regulations: [USER INPUT - HIPAA, GDPR, SOC2, etc.]
