# System Blueprint Creation Guide

**Welcome!** This guide will help you transform your project idea into a comprehensive System Blueprint through collaboration with Claude Code.

**Time Investment**: 3-4 hours for a complete blueprint
**Output**: A professional `SYSTEM_BLUEPRINT.md` ready for your new project repository

---

## How This Works

This is an **interactive process** where:
- 👤 **You provide**: Vision, requirements, constraints, preferences
- 🤖 **Claude analyzes**: Context, implications, trade-offs
- 🎯 **Claude recommends**: Architecture, tech stack, patterns, strategies
- 💬 **You decide**: Approve, adjust, or reject recommendations

The process is divided into **6 phases**. You can:
- Work through them sequentially (recommended for first-time users)
- Jump to specific sections: "Let's work on section 3.2"
- Take breaks and resume anytime

---

## The 6 Phases

### Phase 1: Vision & Strategy (30-45 min)
Define your project's purpose, goals, and constraints

### Phase 2: Product Definition (45-60 min)
Describe users, features, and extensibility needs

### Phase 3: Technical Architecture (60-90 min)
Claude recommends architecture, tech stack, and design patterns

### Phase 4: Data & API Design (45-60 min)
Claude designs data models and API endpoints

### Phase 5: Operations & Quality (30-45 min)

---

# Phase 1: Vision & Strategy

**Goal**: Establish project purpose, goals, and constraints
**Your Role**: Provide business context and vision
**Claude's Role**: Clarify, structure, and identify gaps

---

## 1.1 Core Vision Statement

### Prompts:
1. **What is your project?** Describe it in 2-3 sentences.
2. **What problem does it solve?** What pain point are you addressing?
3. **Who is it for?** Who are your target users?

### Example:
```
"A collaborative task management tool that helps remote teams
coordinate work across time zones with asynchronous communication
and automatic scheduling."
```

### Claude's Role:
- Ask clarifying questions
- Help refine the vision statement
- Flag vague or overly broad scope
- Ensure the problem is well-defined

### Tips:
- Be specific about the problem, not just the solution
- Focus on the core value proposition
- One clear problem is better than many vague ones

---

## 1.2 Strategic Goals

### Prompts:
1. **What does success look like in 6 months?** In 1 year?
2. **What are your top 3 business objectives?**
3. **Primary goal?**
   - [ ] Generate revenue (SaaS, marketplace)
   - [ ] Grow user base (network effects)
   - [ ] Portfolio/learning project
   - [ ] Internal tool (solve company problem)
   - [ ] Open source community project

### Example:
```
6-month goal: 500 active users, validate product-market fit
1-year goal: 5,000 users, $10K MRR, establish as go-to tool for remote teams

Top objectives:
1. Prove core value proposition (users save 5+ hours/week)
2. Build engaged community (20% weekly active users)
3. Achieve sustainability ($5K MRR covers costs)
```

### Claude's Role:
- Help prioritize conflicting goals
- Identify missing considerations (e.g., sustainability, growth, community)
- Flag unrealistic timelines
- Suggest relevant success criteria

### Tips:
- Be honest about priorities (revenue vs users vs learning)
- Consider sustainability, not just growth
- Set measurable milestones

---

## 1.3 Success Metrics

### Prompts:
1. **How will you measure success?** What numbers matter most?
2. **What metrics will you track?**

### Claude's Suggestions (based on project type):

**SaaS Product:**
- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
- Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)
- Churn rate
- Daily/Monthly Active Users (DAU/MAU)

**Marketplace:**
- Gross Merchandise Value (GMV)
- Take rate (commission %)
- Buyer-to-seller ratio
- Transaction volume

**Content Platform:**
- Engagement rate (time on site, interactions)
- Content creation rate (posts per user)
- Retention (7-day, 30-day)
- Viral coefficient (shares, invites)

**Internal Tool:**
- Time saved per user
- Adoption rate (% of team using)
- Task completion rate
- Error reduction

### Claude's Role:
- Suggest relevant metrics for your project type
- Distinguish vanity metrics (looks good) from actionable metrics (drives decisions)
- Help prioritize which metrics matter most

### Tips:
- Pick 3-5 key metrics, not 20
- Choose metrics you can actually influence
- Balance leading indicators (engagement) with lagging indicators (revenue)

---

## 1.4 Market Positioning

### Prompts:
1. **Who are your competitors or alternatives?** What do people use today?
2. **What makes your approach different?** Why will users switch?
3. **What's your unfair advantage?** What can you do that others can't?

### Example:
```
Competitors: Asana, Trello, Monday.com

Our difference:
- Built specifically for async remote teams (not just task lists)
- AI-powered scheduling across time zones
- Communication embedded in tasks (no context switching)

Unfair advantage:
- Founder has 10 years experience managing remote teams
- Deep understanding of remote work pain points
- Access to 50-person remote company for beta testing
```

### Claude's Role:
- Help identify true competitors (including "do nothing")
- Question weak differentiators ("better UX" isn't enough)
- Validate unfair advantages
- Suggest positioning strategies

### Tips:
- Be realistic about competition
- "Better execution" is not a differentiator
- Consider indirect competitors (spreadsheets, pen and paper)
- Your advantage should be defensible

---

## 1.5 Constraints & Context

This section is **critical** - it drives Claude's architecture recommendations.

### Prompts:

#### Team
1. **Team size?** How many people will build this?
2. **Team composition?** Roles and skills?
3. **Technical expertise?** What languages/frameworks does the team know well?

#### Timeline
1. **When do you want to launch?** Target date for MVP?
2. **Time commitment?** Full-time or part-time?
3. **Hard deadlines?** Any fixed dates (events, funding milestones)?

#### Budget
1. **Development budget?** Bootstrap or funded?
2. **Infrastructure budget?** Monthly spend tolerance for hosting/services?
3. **Tool budget?** Can you pay for development tools/services?

#### Technical
1. **Existing infrastructure?** Building on top of anything?
2. **Must-use technologies?** Any required tech (company standard, personal preference)?
3. **Must-avoid technologies?** Any constraints (licensing, compatibility)?

#### Regulatory/Compliance
1. **Industry regulations?** HIPAA, GDPR, SOC2, etc.?
2. **Data residency?** Must data stay in specific regions?
3. **Security requirements?** Specific security certifications needed?

### Example:
```
Team:
- 2 developers (full-stack, both know Python and React)
- 1 designer (part-time)
- No dedicated DevOps

Timeline:
- MVP in 3 months
- Full-time commitment
- Want to launch at RemoteWeek conference (Sept 15)

Budget:
- Bootstrap (no external funding)
- $500/month max for infrastructure
- Can use free tiers of most services

Technical:
- Team experienced with Python, JavaScript, PostgreSQL
- Prefer open-source tools
- No legacy systems to integrate with

Compliance:
- GDPR compliance needed (EU users)
- No healthcare/financial data
- Standard security practices sufficient
```

### Claude's Role:
- **This is the foundation for all technical recommendations**
- Flag constraint conflicts (e.g., 3-month timeline with complex requirements)
- Suggest compromises when constraints are tight
- Adjust architecture recommendations based on realistic constraints

### Tips:
- Be honest about constraints (Claude needs accurate info)
- Tighter constraints = simpler recommendations
- Budget includes hosting, tools, AND hidden costs (monitoring, email service, etc.)

```

---

# Phase 2: Product Definition

**Goal**: Define users, features, and extensibility requirements
**Your Role**: Describe what you want to build
**Claude's Role**: Structure, prioritize, and assess complexity

---

## 2.1 User Personas

### Prompts:
1. **Who will use this?** Describe 2-3 primary user types
2. **What are their goals?** What are they trying to accomplish?
3. **What are their pain points?** What frustrates them today?
4. **Technical proficiency?** Novice, intermediate, or expert users?
5. **Context of use?** When, where, and how often do they use your product?

### Template for Each Persona:

```
Persona: [Name/Role]
- Goal: [Primary objective]
- Pain Points: [Current frustrations]
- Tech Savvy: [Low / Medium / High]
- Context: [When/where they use the product]
- Frequency: [Daily / Weekly / Occasionally]
- Success Criteria: [What does success look like for them?]
```

### Example:

```
Persona 1: Remote Team Lead (Sarah)
- Goal: Coordinate 8-person team across 6 time zones
- Pain Points:
  - Too many meetings trying to coordinate async work
  - Context lost in Slack threads
  - Unclear task ownership and status
- Tech Savvy: Medium (comfortable with standard tools)
- Context: Uses daily, primarily during her morning planning time
- Frequency: Daily (30-60 min sessions)
- Success Criteria: Reduced meetings, clear visibility into team progress

Persona 2: Individual Contributor (Dev)
- Goal: Understand what to work on without constant interruptions
- Pain Points:
  - Meetings interrupt deep work
  - Unclear priorities
  - Too many tools to check
- Tech Savvy: High (developer)
- Context: Checks 2-3 times per day between coding sessions
- Frequency: Daily (quick check-ins)
- Success Criteria: Uninterrupted work time, clear priorities

Persona 3: Executive Stakeholder
- Goal: High-level visibility without micromanaging
- Pain Points:
  - No project overview
  - Has to ask for status updates
- Tech Savvy: Low (non-technical)
- Context: Weekly review of project status
- Frequency: Weekly
- Success Criteria: Dashboard view of all projects at a glance
```

### Claude's Role:
- Help create concrete, realistic personas
- Identify overlooked user types
- Structure personas consistently
- Flag conflicts between persona needs
- Identify which persona to prioritize for MVP

### Tips:
- Base personas on real people if possible
- 2-3 personas is ideal (more creates complexity)
- Focus on behaviors and goals, not just demographics
- One persona should be the "primary" for MVP focus

---

## 2.2 Core Features

This is where you describe WHAT you're building.

### Prompts:
1. **What are the 5-7 core features for MVP?** Focus on essential features only.
2. **For each feature, describe**: What does it do? Why is it important?
3. **Must-have vs Nice-to-have**: Honestly categorize each feature.

### Feature Template:

```
Feature: [Name]
Priority: Must-have / Should-have / Nice-to-have
Description: [What does it do?]
User Story: As a [persona], I want to [action] so that [benefit]
Success Criteria: [How do you know it works?]
Dependencies: [What else needs to exist for this to work?]
```

### Example:

```
Feature 1: Task Creation & Assignment
Priority: Must-have
Description: Create tasks with title, description, assignee, due date
User Story: As a team lead, I want to create and assign tasks so that
everyone knows what they're responsible for
Success Criteria:
- Can create task in < 30 seconds
- Assignee gets notified
- Task appears in their queue
Dependencies: User authentication, team management

Feature 2: Async Status Updates
Priority: Must-have
Description: Team members post async updates on tasks without meetings
User Story: As a developer, I want to update task status when I finish
work so that my team knows progress without interrupting me
Success Criteria:
- Can post update in < 1 minute
- Team lead sees updates in their dashboard
- Timezone-appropriate notifications
Dependencies: Task Creation, Notification system

Feature 3: Time Zone Scheduler
Priority: Should-have (MVP v1.1)
Description: AI suggests best times for collaboration across time zones
User Story: As a team lead, I want to find overlap hours so that I can
schedule sync meetings when needed
Success Criteria:
- Shows overlap hours for selected team members
- Suggests best meeting times
- Accounts for work preferences (morning person, etc.)
Dependencies: User profiles with timezone, Task system

Feature 4: Dashboard Overview
Priority: Must-have
Description: At-a-glance view of all active tasks and recent updates
User Story: As an executive, I want to see project status so that I
understand progress without asking for updates
Success Criteria:
- Loads in < 2 seconds
- Shows key metrics (tasks done, blockers, etc.)
- No data entry required (auto-populated)
Dependencies: Task tracking, Status updates

Feature 5: Team Chat Integration
Priority: Nice-to-have (v2.0)
Description: Integrate with Slack/Teams for notifications
User Story: As a team member, I want updates in my existing chat tool
so that I don't have to check another app
Success Criteria:
- Receives notifications in Slack
- Can respond to simple actions from Slack
Dependencies: Task system, OAuth integration

Feature 6: File Attachments
Priority: Should-have
Description: Attach files to tasks (designs, docs, etc.)
User Story: As a team member, I want to attach context to tasks so
that others have all the information they need
Success Criteria:
- Support common file types (pdf, images, docs)
- Max 10MB per file
- Preview for images
Dependencies: Task system, cloud storage
```

### Claude's Role:
- **Assess technical complexity** for each feature (Low/Medium/High)
- Challenge scope creep ("Is this really needed for MVP?")
- Identify missing foundational features (auth, onboarding, etc.)
- Flag features that are underspecified
- Suggest MVP reduction strategies if timeline is tight
- **Analyze technical requirements** (e.g., "Async updates needs WebSockets or polling")

### Claude's Complexity Assessment:

```
Feature 1: Task Creation - LOW
- Standard CRUD operations
- Well-established patterns
- 2-3 days development

Feature 2: Async Status Updates - MEDIUM
- Real-time notifications needed
- Timezone handling adds complexity
- 5-7 days development

Feature 3: Time Zone Scheduler - HIGH
- AI/algorithm development
- Complex timezone logic
- External calendar API integration?
- 10-15 days development
- Recommend: Move to v1.1

Feature 4: Dashboard - MEDIUM
- Data aggregation and visualization
- Performance considerations for large teams
- 4-5 days development

Feature 5: Chat Integration - MEDIUM/HIGH
- OAuth implementation
- Third-party API integration
- Ongoing maintenance (API changes)
- 7-10 days development
- Recommend: v2.0 (not critical path)

Feature 6: File Attachments - MEDIUM
- File upload/storage
- Security considerations
- 3-4 days development
```

### Tips:
- 5-7 features max for MVP (you can always add more later)
- Each feature should map to a user persona's core need
- "Must-have" should be truly essential (would you skip launch without it?)
- Defer "Nice-to-have" features without guilt

---

## 2.3 User Flows

### Prompts:
1. **Walk through the primary user journey**: What does a user do from start to finish?
2. **Happy path**: Describe the ideal scenario
3. **Edge cases**: What happens when things go wrong?

### Example Flow:

```
Primary Flow: Team Lead Creates and Assigns Task

Happy Path:
1. User logs in (sees dashboard)
2. Clicks "New Task"
3. Fills in: title, description, assignee (dropdown), due date
4. Clicks "Create"
5. Task appears in their dashboard
6. Assignee receives notification
7. Assignee sees task in their queue

Edge Cases:
- What if assignee is not on their team?
  → Show only team members in dropdown
- What if due date is in the past?
  → Show warning, allow anyway (might be backlog)
- What if assignee has too many tasks?
  → Show workload warning ("Sarah has 15 open tasks")
- What if notification fails?
  → Store in queue, retry, show in-app notification as backup
```

### Claude's Role:
- Identify gaps in the flow (what's missing?)
- Suggest error states and validations
- Map flows to features (ensure all features have flows)
- Flag complex flows that increase development time

### Tips:
- Focus on 2-3 primary flows for MVP
- Draw it out if helpful (whiteboard, Miro, etc.)
- Think about the "day 1" experience vs "day 100" experience
- Error handling is not optional (plan for it now)

---

## 2.4 Extensibility Vision

**This is critical!** Your answers here will drive architecture decisions in Phase 3.

### Core Questions:

#### Q1: Who should be able to extend this system?

- [ ] **No one** - Closed system, no extensibility needed
- [ ] **Internal developers only** - Our team adds features
- [ ] **Power users** - Advanced users customize via UI settings
- [ ] **Third-party developers** - External devs build plugins/integrations
- [ ] **Everyone** - Full plugin ecosystem with marketplace

#### Q2: What should be extensible?

- [ ] **UI/Theming** - Colors, layout, branding
- [ ] **Workflows** - Custom automation rules
- [ ] **Integrations** - Connect to other services (Slack, GitHub, etc.)
- [ ] **Data models** - Custom fields, entities
- [ ] **Business logic** - Completely new features via plugins
- [ ] **Reports/Analytics** - Custom dashboards and metrics

#### Q3: Timeline for extensibility?

- [ ] **MVP (v1.0)** - Extensibility is core to the product
- [ ] **Post-launch (v2.0)** - Add after proving core product
- [ ] **Future** - Not a priority, maybe someday
- [ ] **Never** - This is not an extensible product

#### Q4: Extensibility models you admire?

Examples:
- **Shopify apps** - Full ecosystem, marketplace, revenue sharing
- **VSCode extensions** - Open API, easy to build, large community
- **Zapier integrations** - Pre-built connectors, no code needed
- **WordPress plugins** - Hooks and filters, PHP-based
- **Notion databases** - User-created templates and structures
- **Airtable bases** - Custom schemas and automations
- **GitHub Actions** - YAML-based workflows, marketplace

**Which resonates with your vision?**

### Example Responses:

**Example 1: No Extensibility (Internal Tool)**
```
Q1: Internal developers only
Q2: Not applicable
Q3: Never - this is a focused internal tool
Q4: None - we want simplicity

Implications:
→ Monolithic architecture is fine
→ Faster development
→ Focus on core features
→ Easier to maintain
```

**Example 2: Medium Extensibility (API + Webhooks)**
```
Q1: Third-party developers can integrate via API
Q2: Integrations with other services
Q3: Post-launch (v2.0) - focus on core product first
Q4: Like Zapier integrations - pre-built connectors

Implications:
→ API-first design
→ Webhook system for events
→ Clear API documentation
→ OAuth for third-party access
→ Modular architecture
```

**Example 3: High Extensibility (Plugin Ecosystem)**
```
Q1: Third-party developers build plugins
Q2: Everything - UI, workflows, integrations, business logic
Q3: MVP (v1.0) - extensibility is the product
Q4: Like VSCode extensions - easy to build, great DX

Implications:
→ Event-driven architecture
→ Plugin SDK (JavaScript/TypeScript)
→ Sandboxed execution environment
→ Plugin marketplace
→ Strict API versioning
→ Developer documentation and tools
→ Significant upfront investment
```

### Claude's Role:

After you answer, Claude will:

1. **Explain implications** of your choices
   - How it affects architecture
   - Development time impact
   - Ongoing maintenance burden
   - Ecosystem opportunities

2. **Provide recommendation** based on your constraints
   - Team size → Can you support a plugin ecosystem?
   - Timeline → Should extensibility be MVP or v2?
   - Budget → Can you afford the infrastructure?

3. **Suggest appropriate level** if yours seems mismatched
   - "Given your 3-month timeline and 2-person team, I recommend deferring full plugin system to v2.0"

### Example Claude Response:

```
Based on your answers:

Extensibility Level: HIGH (Plugin ecosystem)

Implications:
✓ Pros:
  - Opens up to third-party innovation
  - Potential marketplace revenue stream
  - Builds community and ecosystem
  - Reduces your feature development burden

✗ Cons:
  - Adds 4-6 weeks to MVP timeline
  - Requires plugin SDK, documentation, tools
  - Ongoing: API versioning and backward compatibility
  - Support burden (plugin issues)
  - Security considerations (sandboxing)

Reality Check:
⚠️  Given your constraints (2 developers, 3-month timeline),
a full plugin system may delay your core product launch.

My Recommendation:
→ Phase 1 (MVP): Build with extensibility in mind (modular architecture)
→ Phase 2 (Month 4-6): Add public API and webhook system
→ Phase 3 (Month 7+): Launch plugin SDK and marketplace

This gets your core product to market faster while preserving
the ability to add full extensibility later.

Alternative:
If plugins are truly core to your value proposition (like VSCode),
extend timeline to 5-6 months for MVP.

Does this make sense? Do you want to adjust your extensibility vision?
```

### Tips:
- Be honest about priorities (extensibility takes time)
- "Maybe later" is a valid answer
- You can always add extensibility, but it's harder to retrofit
- If unsure, start with Medium (API + webhooks) and expand later

---

## 2.5 Non-Functional Requirements

Often overlooked, but important!

### Prompts:

#### Performance
- **Expected load?** How many concurrent users?
- **Response time expectations?** How fast should actions feel?
- **Data volume?** How much data will users generate?

#### Security
- **Data sensitivity?** Public, internal, or highly sensitive?
- **Authentication method?** Email/password, social login, SSO?
- **Compliance needs?** GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2, etc.?

#### Scalability
- **Growth expectations?** 100 users, 10K users, 1M users?
- **Timeline for scale?** When do you expect to hit growth milestones?

#### Availability
- **Uptime requirements?** 99%? 99.9%? 99.99%?
- **Business impact of downtime?** Lost revenue? User frustration?

#### Accessibility
- **Accessibility requirements?** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance?
- **Internationalization?** Multiple languages needed?

### Example:

```
Performance:
- Expected load: 100 concurrent users initially, 5K by year 1
- Response time: < 2 seconds for page loads, < 500ms for actions
- Data volume: ~1GB per 1000 users

Security:
- Data sensitivity: Medium (work data, not financial/health)
- Authentication: Email/password + Google OAuth
- Compliance: GDPR compliance needed (EU users)

Scalability:
- Year 1: 5,000 users
- Year 2: 50,000 users
- Architecture should handle 10x current load

Availability:
- Target: 99.5% uptime (3.6 hours downtime/month acceptable)
- Impact: User frustration but not catastrophic
- Maintenance windows: Acceptable during low-traffic hours

Accessibility:
- Basic accessibility (semantic HTML, keyboard navigation)
- Not seeking WCAG certification for MVP
- Internationalization: English only for MVP, plan for i18n later
```

### Claude's Role:
- Help set realistic targets based on project stage
- Flag over-engineering ("99.99% uptime on day 1 is expensive")
- Identify requirements that affect architecture choices
- Suggest phased approach (MVP vs later requirements)

---

## 2.6 Out of Scope

Explicitly document what you're NOT building.

### Prompts:
1. **What features have you considered and rejected?** Why?
2. **What adjacent problems will you NOT solve?** Clear boundaries.
3. **What integrations will you NOT support?** At least initially.

### Example:

```
Out of Scope (MVP):

❌ Mobile apps - Web-first, mobile later
❌ Time tracking - Focus on task management, not time
❌ Billing/invoicing - This is not a financial tool
❌ Video calls - Use existing tools (Zoom, Meet)
❌ Email client - We integrate, not replace
❌ Project templates - Too complex for MVP
❌ Gantt charts - Too enterprise-focused
❌ Calendar integration - V2 feature
❌ Custom branding - V2 feature

Reasoning:
- Mobile apps: 3x development time, can use responsive web
- Time tracking: Different use case, avoid scope creep
- Video calls: Reinventing wheel, focus on our differentiation
```

### Tips:
- This list prevents future scope creep
- Refer back to this when tempted to add features
- Share with stakeholders to align expectations

---

## Phase 2 Complete! 🎉

### What Claude Will Do Now:

1. **Summarize** your product definition
2. **Assess** technical complexity of features
3. **Identify** potential risks or gaps
4. **Calculate** rough development timeline
5. **Ask** clarifying questions
6. **Save** Phase 2 to SYSTEM_BLUEPRINT.md

### Sample Summary:

```
Product Definition Summary:

Personas:
- Team Lead (primary for MVP)
- Individual Contributor
- Executive Stakeholder

Core Features (Must-Have):
✓ Task Creation & Assignment (LOW complexity)
✓ Async Status Updates (MEDIUM complexity)
✓ Dashboard Overview (MEDIUM complexity)
✓ File Attachments (MEDIUM complexity)

Total MVP Complexity: 20-25 development days

Extensibility Vision:
- Medium (API + webhooks)
- Timeline: v2.0 (post-launch)

Non-Functional:
- 5K users year 1
- GDPR compliance
- 99.5% uptime target

This is achievable with your team and timeline.

🚨 Recommendations:
1. Defer "Time Zone Scheduler" to v1.1 (HIGH complexity)
2. Defer "Chat Integration" to v2.0 (not critical path)
3. Focus MVP on core task management + async updates

Ready for Phase 3: Technical Architecture?
This is where I'll recommend your tech stack and architecture pattern.
```

# Phase 3: Technical Architecture

**Goal**: Define technical approach and architecture
**Your Role**: Review and adjust Claude's recommendations
**Claude's Role**: Propose architecture, tech stack, and patterns based on all previous inputs

**This is where Claude does most of the heavy lifting!**

---

## 3.1 Architecture Philosophy

Claude analyzes your inputs and proposes an architecture approach.

### Claude's Analysis Process:

1. **Team Size** → Complexity tolerance
   - 1-2 developers → Monolith (simpler)
   - 3-5 developers → Modular monolith
   - 5+ developers → Microservices (if needed)

2. **Timeline** → Pragmatism
   - < 3 months → Proven technologies, monolith
   - 3-6 months → Can experiment slightly
   - 6+ months → More architectural flexibility

3. **Extensibility Needs** → Architecture pattern
   - None/Low → Monolith is fine
   - Medium → Modular monolith with clear boundaries
   - High → Event-driven architecture for plugins

4. **Scale Expectations** → Initial architecture
   - < 10K users → Single server initially
   - 10-100K users → Plan for horizontal scaling
   - 100K+ users → Distributed from the start

5. **Feature Complexity** → Architecture decisions
   - Real-time features → WebSocket support
   - File uploads → Separate storage service
   - Complex queries → Caching strategy

### Claude's Proposal Format:

```
RECOMMENDED ARCHITECTURE: Modular Monolith

Decision Rationale:

✓ Team Size (2 developers)
  → Monolithic deployment is manageable
  → Less operational complexity
  → Faster development velocity

✓ Timeline (3 months)
  → Proven, stable approach
  → Avoid distributed systems complexity
  → Focus on features, not infrastructure

✓ Extensibility (Medium - API + webhooks in v2)
  → Modular design allows future separation
  → Clear service boundaries within monolith
  → Can extract to microservices if needed

✓ Scale (5K users year 1)
  → Single server handles this easily
  → Vertical scaling sufficient initially
  → Can add read replicas at 10K+ users

✓ Feature Set
  → Real-time updates → WebSocket server in same process
  → File uploads → S3-compatible storage
  → No features requiring service separation

Architecture Pattern:
- Single application deployment
- Modular code structure (clear service layers)
- Shared database (PostgreSQL)
- Background jobs (same process or simple queue)

Trade-offs:

✓ Pros:
  + Faster development (no network calls between services)
  + Simpler deployment (one thing to deploy)
  + Easier debugging (single codebase)
  + Lower infrastructure cost
  + Simpler data model (no distributed transactions)

✗ Cons:
  - All features scale together (can't scale independently)
  - One deployment for all changes
  - Requires discipline to maintain modularity

When to Revisit:
→ At 50K+ users (consider service extraction)
→ If one feature becomes bottleneck (extract to service)
→ If team grows to 5+ developers (consider separation)
→ If extensibility becomes core product (event-driven rewrite)

Future Evolution Path:
1. Current: Modular monolith
2. If needed: Extract high-traffic features to services
3. Long-term: Microservices if truly needed

Does this architecture align with your vision?

## 3.2 Technology Stack Recommendation

Claude proposes a complete tech stack with detailed reasoning.

### Claude's Decision Process:

**Factors Considered:**
- Team's existing skills
- Timeline constraints
- Feature requirements (real-time, file uploads, etc.)
- Extensibility needs
- Community support and ecosystem
- Hiring considerations
- Long-term maintainability

### Claude's Proposal:

```

### Your Response Options:

**Option 1: Approve**
```
User: "This looks great! Let's go with this stack."
Claude: "Excellent! I'll save this to the blueprint. Ready for section 3.3?"
```

**Option 2: Adjust**
```
User: "I prefer Node.js backend since the whole team knows JavaScript"
Claude: "Good point! Let me revise:

Backend: Node.js + Express + TypeScript
Why:
✓ Team knows JavaScript (single language across stack)
✓ Excellent async support (real-time features)
✓ Large ecosystem
✓ Easy to hire for

ORM: Prisma
Why:
✓ Type-safe, modern
✓ Great DX with migrations
✓ Auto-completion in IDE

Background Jobs: BullMQ
Why:
✓ Redis-based (like Celery)
✓ Great TypeScript support
✓ Excellent observability

[Updated cost and architecture diagrams...]

Better?"
```

**Option 3: Question**
```
User: "Why FastAPI over Django? Django has more built-in features"
Claude: "Great question! Here's the trade-off:

Django:
✓ More batteries included (admin, ORM, auth)
✓ Monolithic (everything in one framework)
✓ Mature, stable, well-documented
✗ Heavier, slower for APIs
✗ Less modern async support
✗ More opinionated structure

FastAPI:
✓ Modern, fast (async-first)
✓ Lightweight (choose what you need)
✓ Great for APIs (automatic docs)
✓ Microservices-friendly (future-proof)
✗ Less built-in (need to add things)
✗ Younger ecosystem

For your project:
- API-first product → FastAPI advantage
- Real-time features → FastAPI async is better
- 3-month timeline → FastAPI is faster to develop APIs
- Future API for third parties → FastAPI auto-docs

If you were building a traditional web app with lots of server-side
rendering and admin panels, Django would be better.

Want to stick with FastAPI or switch to Django?"
```

## 3.3 Data Architecture

Claude designs your data strategy.

### Claude's Proposal:

```
DATA ARCHITECTURE STRATEGY

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PRIMARY STORAGE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Database: PostgreSQL

Data Distribution:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ PostgreSQL (Primary Database)           │
│                                          │
│  Core Business Data:                    │
│   - Users, Teams, Memberships           │
│   - Tasks, Assignments, Status          │
│   - Comments, Activity Log              │
│   - Permissions, Roles                  │
│                                          │
│  Estimated Data Growth:                 │
│   - Year 1: ~5GB (5K users)            │
│   - Year 2: ~50GB (50K users)          │
│   - Well within PostgreSQL limits       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

Why Not NoSQL (MongoDB, etc.)?
✗ Your data is relational (users, teams, tasks)
✗ Need referential integrity (foreign keys)
✗ Complex queries benefit from SQL
✗ ACID transactions important (task assignments)
✓ PostgreSQL JSONB gives flexibility where needed

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
FILE STORAGE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Strategy: S3-Compatible Object Storage (Cloudflare R2)

What Goes Here:
- User-uploaded files (attachments)
- User avatars
- Team logos
- Exported reports (PDFs)

Why Not Database?
✗ BLOBs slow down database
✗ Expensive to scale
✗ Difficult to serve directly (no CDN)

Why R2 Over S3?
✓ Free egress (AWS charges for downloads)
✓ S3-compatible (easy to switch)
✓ Cloudflare CDN integration

File Reference Pattern:
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Database (PostgreSQL)                    │
│  - file_id: uuid                         │
│  - file_name: "design.pdf"              │
│  - file_size: 2048576                   │
│  - mime_type: "application/pdf"         │
│  - storage_key: "uploads/abc123..."     │
│  - uploaded_by: user_id                 │
│  - uploaded_at: timestamp               │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
                  │
                  │ reference
                  ▼
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ R2 Object Storage                        │
│  Key: uploads/abc123.../design.pdf       │
│  Object: [binary data]                   │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘

Security:
- Signed URLs (expiring links)
- No direct public access
- Virus scanning (ClamAV for uploads)
- Size limits (10MB per file for MVP)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
CACHE LAYER
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Technology: Redis

What Gets Cached:
1. Session Data
   - JWT refresh tokens
   - User session state
   - TTL: 30 days

2. Frequently Accessed Data
   - User profiles (cache after first load)
   - Team membership info
   - Dashboard counts (tasks, notifications)
   - TTL: 5-15 minutes

3. Rate Limiting
   - API request counts per user
   - TTL: 1 hour window

4. Background Job Queue
   - Celery task queue
   - Job results (short-term)

5. Real-time Pub/Sub
   - WebSocket room management
   - Live notification delivery

Cache Invalidation Strategy:
- Write-through: Update cache when data changes
- TTL: Expire after time period
- Event-based: Clear on specific actions

Example: User updates task status
1. Update PostgreSQL
2. Invalidate cache key: "task:{task_id}"
3. Publish event to WebSocket subscribers
4. Next read fetches fresh data and caches it

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
SEARCH
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MVP: PostgreSQL Full-Text Search
Why:
✓ Good enough for MVP (tasks, users, comments)
✓ No additional infrastructure
✓ Simple to implement
✓ Handles 10-50K records easily

Example:
```sql
SELECT * FROM tasks
WHERE to_tsvector('english', title || ' ' || description)
@@ to_tsquery('english', 'async & remote');
```

Future (if needed at scale):
- ElasticSearch or Typesense
- When: 50K+ users, complex search requirements
- Why defer: Adds operational complexity

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
BACKUP STRATEGY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Database Backups:
- Automated daily backups (Railway/Render built-in)
- Retention: 7 days (free tier), 30 days (paid)
- Point-in-time recovery available

File Storage:
- R2 has versioning built-in
- Can restore deleted files within 30 days

Redis:
- Not backed up (cache can be rebuilt)
- RDB snapshots for queue data (Celery)

Disaster Recovery:
- Database restore: ~5-10 minutes
- Files: Immediate (versioning)
- Acceptable downtime for MVP: 1-2 hours

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
DATA FLOW
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Typical Request Flow:

1. User Action (e.g., "Update Task Status")
         │
         ▼
2. API Request → FastAPI
         │
         ▼
3. Check Cache (Redis) ────────┐
         │ miss              hit│
         ▼                      │
4. Query Database              │
   (PostgreSQL)                │
         │                      │
         └──────────┬───────────┘
                    │
                    ▼
5. Update Cache (write-through)
         │
         ▼
6. Publish Event (WebSocket/Redis Pub/Sub)
         │
         ▼
7. Background Job? → Celery Queue (Redis)
         │
         ▼
8. Return Response to User

Real-time Notification Flow:

1. Event Occurs (task updated)
         │
         ▼
2. Publish to Redis Pub/Sub channel
         │
         ▼
3. WebSocket Server Receives Event
         │
         ▼
4. Push to Connected Clients in Room
         │
         ▼
5. Browser Updates UI (React state)

This architecture handles your requirements efficiently.

## 3.4 API Design Philosophy

Claude proposes API approach based on your extensibility needs.

### For Medium Extensibility (API + Webhooks):

```
API DESIGN APPROACH

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
API STYLE: RESTful API
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Why REST?
✓ Simple and well-understood
✓ Excellent tooling (OpenAPI, Postman)
✓ Great for CRUD operations (your core features)
✓ Easy to document and consume
✓ HTTP methods map naturally to actions

Base URL Structure:
```
https://api.yourapp.com/v1/...
```

Why /v1/?
- API versioning for backward compatibility
- When v2 needed, v1 continues working
- Critical for third-party integrations

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
AUTHENTICATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

For Web App: JWT in httpOnly Cookies
- Secure (XSS protection)
- Automatic on requests
- Refresh token rotation

For API Clients (future v2): API Keys
- Header: `Authorization: Bearer <api_key>`
- Scoped permissions
- Revocable

For Third-Party Apps (future v2): OAuth 2.0
- Standard authorization flow
- User grants permissions
- Access tokens with expiration

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
RESPONSE FORMAT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Success Response (200, 201):
```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "title": "Task title",
    ...
  },
  "meta": {
    "timestamp": "2025-10-16T12:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

List Response (with pagination):
```json
{
  "data": [ ... ],
  "meta": {
    "page": 1,
    "per_page": 20,
    "total": 145,
    "total_pages": 8
  },
  "links": {
    "first": "/v1/tasks?page=1",
    "prev": null,
    "next": "/v1/tasks?page=2",
    "last": "/v1/tasks?page=8"
  }
}
```

Error Response (4xx, 5xx):
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Task title is required",
    "details": {
      "field": "title",
      "constraint": "required"
    }
  },
  "meta": {
    "request_id": "req_abc123",
    "timestamp": "2025-10-16T12:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

HTTP Status Codes:
- 200: Success (GET, PATCH)
- 201: Created (POST)
- 204: No Content (DELETE)
- 400: Bad Request (validation error)
- 401: Unauthorized (not logged in)
- 403: Forbidden (no permission)
- 404: Not Found
- 429: Too Many Requests (rate limit)
- 500: Internal Server Error

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
RATE LIMITING
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Strategy:
- 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP (anonymous)
- 1000 requests per hour per authenticated user
- Lower limits for expensive operations (file uploads)

Headers:
```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 1000
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 999
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1634400000
```

Implementation: Redis (token bucket algorithm)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
WEBHOOK SYSTEM (v2.0)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Events to Expose:
- task.created
- task.updated
- task.completed
- comment.added
- user.invited
- team.created

Webhook Payload Format:
```json
{
  "event": "task.created",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-16T12:00:00Z",
  "data": {
    "id": "task_abc123",
    "title": "New task",
    ...
  },
  "team_id": "team_xyz"
}
```

Webhook Delivery:
- POST to user-configured URL
- Signature verification (HMAC)
- Retry logic (3 attempts with exponential backoff)
- Delivery logs and status

Security:
- Signature header: `X-Webhook-Signature`
- Verify: HMAC-SHA256(secret, payload)
- Reject unsigned webhooks

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
API DOCUMENTATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Auto-Generated: OpenAPI 3.0 (via FastAPI)

Documentation Site:
- Swagger UI at /docs (interactive)
- ReDoc at /redoc (clean, printable)
- OpenAPI spec at /openapi.json (machine-readable)

Example:
https://api.yourapp.com/docs

Features:
- Try-it-out functionality
- Request/response examples
- Schema definitions
- Authentication flows

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
DEPRECATION POLICY (for v2+)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

When API changes needed:
1. Add new endpoint/field (v1 continues working)
2. Mark old endpoint as deprecated
3. Add warning header: `X-API-Deprecated: true`
4. Email developers using deprecated endpoints
5. Support old version for 12 months minimum
6. Remove old version in next major version (v2)

Deprecation Header:
```
X-API-Deprecated: true
X-API-Sunset: 2026-10-16T00:00:00Z
Link: <https://docs.yourapp.com/api/migration-guide>; rel="deprecation"
```

This ensures third-party apps don't break unexpectedly.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
SUMMARY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

API Maturity:
- MVP (v1.0): REST API for frontend only
- v2.0: Public API + Webhooks
- v3.0: Enhanced API with more granular permissions

This approach:
✓ Starts simple (focus on core product)
✓ Enables future extensibility
✓ Standard patterns (easy for developers)
✓ Well-documented (automatic via FastAPI)

Ready for section 3.5: Security Architecture?
